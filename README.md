## 🔒 Security Fork - What's Changed

This is a **security-focused fork** of [@dabeng/react-orgchart](https://github.com/dabeng/react-orgchart) that addresses critical vulnerabilities:

### ✅ **Security Fixes**
- **Removed jspdf dependency** that had vulnerable dompurify chain (CVE-2024-47068)
- **Eliminated PDF export** to remove security risk entirely
- **Reduced vulnerabilities** from 40+ to 9 in dependency tree

### ✅ **New Features**
- **Added JPEG export** with 92% quality setting
- **Maintained PNG export** functionality
- **Same API** - drop-in replacement for existing projects

### 📦 **Installation**

**Replace vulnerable dependency:**
```bash
# Remove the vulnerable package
npm uninstall @dabeng/react-orgchart

# Install the secure version
npm install @meirpro/react-orgchart
```

**For new projects:**
```bash
npm install @meirpro/react-orgchart
```

### 🚀 **Usage** (JPEG Export)
```javascript
// Import the secure version (same API)
import OrganizationChart from '@meirpro/react-orgchart';

// Export as JPEG (NEW!)
chartRef.current.exportTo('my-chart', 'jpeg');
// Export as PNG (existing)
chartRef.current.exportTo('my-chart', 'png');
```

### 🔄 **Migration from @dabeng/react-orgchart**
1. Replace import: `import OrganizationChart from '@meirpro/react-orgchart';`
2. Update any PDF export calls to use JPEG: `exportTo('filename', 'jpeg')`
3. Everything else works exactly the same!

## Install

```

## [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-orgchart-demo-o3nf6)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
